# beautiful-saber
A clone of beautiful-jekyll but for Saber.land.

## WORK IN PROGRESS. CHECK BACK LATER.

## What it is?
This is a starter project/theme for [saber.land](https://saber.land/).

If you haven't checked it out saber, you should. It's a wonderful project that has the potential to solve world hunger (or something).

## Back story (_every project needs one_)

I loved [beautiful-jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) back in the day. I had blogs (plural) on the theme, and am thankful for the author's effort.

Now that I am in a position to spare effort to do something, what better way could there be to get that design to newer heights? So then, I created beautiful-saber. Hopefully, it will not lessen the image/impact of the original theme.
